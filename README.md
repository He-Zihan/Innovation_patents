In this project, I primarily constructed several patent-related indicators. Among them, the measure of firm innovation dispersion follows the logic of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) at the major group level to weight firm patents. The specific calculation method for innovation dispersion is as follows:
innovation_dispersion=1−∑α^2
where α represents the proportion of each major group classification in the total patent classifications. A higher innovation_dispersion value indicates greater differences between the major group classifications of patent categories, suggesting that the firm's innovation activities are more diversified across different technological fields.
